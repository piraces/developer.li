Repo for the developer.li website.

developer.li offers free subdomains for developers, powered by [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/).

The main site is made using the [NES-style CSS Framework](https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css) and Angular.
It offers a simple check tool for available subdomains and a short tutorial about how to get started.
